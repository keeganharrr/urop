    "operationalSuccesses": "Savings for 2018-2019, when the geothermal heating system was introduced, was about $70,000. Estimated savings for 2019-2020, when build renovations for the campuses were projected to be complete, was $85,000. The school district would also sell geothermal heat to the community medical center, resulting in approximately $20,000 annual additional revenue for the school district. MJUSD is estimated to save $6.5 million in energy costs over the life of the system, which is likely to last as long as 30 years. MJUSD plans to use the savings to fund a variety of things including: field trips to colleges, increase student access to technology, provide professional development for staff, hire additional staff to meet the increasingly complex needs of students, and fund field trips to enhance student career options. The revenues received from LFHD will go into the school district general fund and be available to purchase equipment, supplies, books, and technology. MJUSD also plans to use the heating system to help teach students about geothermal resources and their applications. Kindergarten through high school students will be able to learn about geothermal resources in the classroom and see how a functioning system operates.",

The project developers also noted that retrofitting the existing building systems as much as possible and using existing equipment from 1992 did reduce costs, but resulted in extended project time, required coordination between designers and contractors during the installation process, and had unexpected delays due to the need to repair or replacement of the old pipes and equipment. Prior to the building retrofits, the geothermal system only operated at 60% of its potential.",

Installation was 30% less expensive due to a decentralized loop field for each heat pump than a centralized approach, the design had a smaller footprint and lower piping costs. Avoiding the use of redundant, individually controlled consoles and less ductwork and piping makes it 12% cheaper to operate than a centralized system.",
